h2. Configatron vs. Settings

Previously, site settings were stored in the database. Now, you have two options for storing configuration settings.

1. Configatron config/config.yml

All default configuration options that are not ‘user changeable’ should go in config/config.yml. This uses the Configatron gem (frozen in vendor/gems).

To retrieve the site name you may use ‘configatron.site_name’ everywhere in your code.

2. Settings in database

It’s still possible to store user changeable settings in the database model Setting.

Note: As long as there are no Settings in the database, the ‘Settings’ tab for the administrator is hidden. Once you add a Setting to the database through a migration (or otherwise), the Settings tab will show up.
